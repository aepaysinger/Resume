    <p8>I fell in love with Camp Colman at 5 years old. I went every summer and participated in  their Leadership program. During highschool I volunteered at the camp and until I was old enough to be hired.
        I started as a counselor/lifeguard, and worked my way up to Assistant Waterfront Director, Waterfront Director, and ultimately Head Female Counselor. 
        While at camp I learned how to bring kids of all different backgrounds together and find common goals. It was my job to help ensure that all campers felt safe and included. 
        A couple ways I demonstrated this was by updating the Emergency Action Plan and doing wellness checks with campers.<br>
